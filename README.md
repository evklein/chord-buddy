### Note
There may be some concept similarity here to a previous project of mine, [Chordulator](https://github.com/hasherr/Chordulator). Though conceptually they seem similar, there is no overlap of code or reuse of previous features from Chordulator. Features of Chord Buddy are more social and will involve a lot more backend code than Chordulator, which lacked a a place for server side code to run completely.

If all goes well with this, I do plan on combining the projects in my own time, though the integration will likely be Chordulator components being integrated into this project rather than the other way around.
